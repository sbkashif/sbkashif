- 👋 Hi, I’m Salman
- 👀 I’m interested in compuational molecular science
- 🌱 I’m currently using advanced simulation techniques to study membrane fouling and selectivity
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a) applying advanced statistical tools for better analyzing my molecular simulation trajectories  and b) exploring parallel programming versions of my codes.
- 📫 You can reach out to me at `sbinkas@clemson.edu`
