- 👋 Hi, I’m Salman
- 👀 I’m interested in molecular modeling and scientific software development
- 🌱 I’m currently using molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning to study fouling and selectivity in water filtration membranes
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a) applying advanced statistical methods to analyze my simulation data  and b) exploring parallel programming versions of my codes.
- 📫 You can reach out to me at `sbinkas [at] clemson.edu`
